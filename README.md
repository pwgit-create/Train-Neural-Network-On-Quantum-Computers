# Train-Neural-Network-On-Quantum-Computers

I created a project that is a good code base that is a solid foundation for training a neural network algorithm on a quantum computer (using the Newton Algorithm) One method is left unimplemented since it should be run on a quantum computer. That step is Calculating the Eigen values.

IÂ´ve provided a class (not part of the original code base creation) that demonstrates how fast you can calculate Eigen values on a classical computer (on a sample matrix). Kind of fast but you can go deeper with QC. 

Please fork the repo if you want to improve it and take this further.
